      <h1>Comparative Study on Different Types of Computers</h1>
      <p>
        Computers play a significant role in our daily lives, assisting with
        everything from simple tasks<br />
        to complex operations across various industries. Understanding the
        different types of computers<br />
        is essential, as each is designed for specific purposes.
        <br />
        <br />
        For instance, personal computers are ideal for individual tasks like
        work and entertainment,<br />
        while supercomputers are utilized for advanced applications such as
        weather forecasting and<br />
        scientific research. Recognizing these distinctions helps us appreciate
        how computers are tailored<br />
        to meet the diverse needs of people and businesses worldwide.
        <br />
        <br />
        With countless tasks requiring computers, relying on a single type to
        handle them all isn't<br />
        practical. Technological advancements have led to the development of
        various computer types,<br />
        each designed to fulfill a specific function.

        <h3>Digital Computers</h3>
        <p>
          Digital computers, such as personal computers, operate using binary
          inputâ€”combinations of 0s<br />
          and 1s. They process this binary data to produce outputs and can
          perform both logical and<br />
          arithmetic operations. Any input, regardless of language or format, is
          first converted into binary<br />
          before being processed. Examples of digital computers include laptops,
          desktops, mobile phones, and PCs.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <h3>Analog Computers</h3>
        <p>
          Analog computers handle analog data, which continuously varies and
          lacks discrete values.<br />
          These computers measure changes in input signals, process the data,
          and provide outputs.<br />
          Although they are slightly less precise and slower than digital
          computers, they are still highly<br />
          effective for specific tasks. Common applications include
          speedometers, thermometers, voltage<br />
          signal analysis, and measuring resistance in capacitors.
          <br />
          <br />
        </p>
        <h3>Hybrid Computers</h3>
        <p>
          Hybrid computers combine the capabilities of both digital and analog
          computers.<br />
          They are designed for high-speed, efficient processing of complex
          calculations. Hybrid computers take<br />
          input in analog form, convert it to digital form, process it, and then
          provide an output. They are<br />
          widely used in scientific research and specialized fields, such as
          measuring patients' heartbeats in<br />
          hospitals or analyzing earthquakes and other natural phenomena in
          research institutions.
