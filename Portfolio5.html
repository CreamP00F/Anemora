      <h1>Comparative Study on Different Types of Motherboards</h1>
      <p>
        A motherboard is a circuit board inside general-purpose computing
        systems,<br />
        including personal computers, smart televisions, smart monitors, and
        other<br />
        similar devices, which supports communication between different
        electrical<br />
        components and houses components such as the CPU, memory, etc.
        <br />
        <br />
        A computer's motherboard is typically the largest printed circuit board
        in a<br />
        machine's chassis. It distributes electricity and facilitates
        communication<br />
        between and to the central processing unit (CPU), random access
        memory<br />
        (RAM), and any other component of the computer's hardware. There is a<br />
        broad range of motherboards, each of which is intended to be
        compatible<br />
        with a specific model and size of the computer.
        <br />
        <br />
        A computer motherboard may be found inside a computer casing, which
        is<br />
        the point of connection for most of the computer's elements and
        peripherals.<br />
        When it comes to tower computers, one may look for a motherboard on
        either<br />
        the right or left side of the tower; the circuit board is the most
        significant.
